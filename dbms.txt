ACID PROPERTIES --
Atomicity -
all sql statement are executed or non should execute
Consitency -
all data inserted or updated should be in valid data type and follow all rules and constrains
Isolation-
one transcation should not effect another transcation.
Durability -
inserted and commited data must not be lost even there is power failure.

primary key - 
foreign key - maintain referential integrity constrain
              (value of foreign key must be present in primary key)
may occurs violation--
for referecing table-
on deletion or on updation

for referenced table-
on insertion,

dependency preservation decomposition-
first of all attributes must not be lost
don't take trivial dependency 

cascading schedule -- error due to write read conflect
cascadeless schedule -- we can avoid cascading schedule error(means we are not allowing the read operatin after the write operation)(but there is also one problem if we perform write after write)

indexing-
key-uniqueness
non key-non uniqueness
primary index correspondes to key

B-tree ---
B-tree follows binary search tree method,and must be in sorted.
for minimus children --
	for even - /2 and +1
	for odd - /2 and take upper value
