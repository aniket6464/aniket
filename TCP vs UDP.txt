TCP vs UDP 
tcp is connection oriented (before sending the data it creates the connection) while udp is connectionless.
tcp is reliable (like telephone connection) while udp is less reliable.
in tcp error control is mondatory(we have to provide checksum in header of tcp) while in udp it is optional.
tcp is slow compare to udp.
tcp has more overhead (as size of tcp header is more than udp).while udp has less overhead.
tcp provides the flow control and congesion control(take care of receiver window capcity and network capacity) while udp does not provide such facilities.
